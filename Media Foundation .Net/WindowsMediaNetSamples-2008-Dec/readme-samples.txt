WindowsMediaNet Samples 2008-12-09

http://WindowsMediaNet.SourceForge.net

This package contains a selection of samples.  See the descriptions below.  In order
to run ANY of these samples, you must also have the windowsmedianet library, which
can be downloaded at the address above.


Since the last release:
-----------------------
Update AudioPlayer sample to use mixer methods
Add GenerateLa sample


These samples should not be considered commercial quality applications.  They are just 
intended to illustrate how to use some particular feature, or group of features in 
WindowsMediaFormat.  Feel free to polish them into applications of your own, or extract 
sections to use in your own code.  Each sample has (at least one) readme file.  
If you are looking for info regarding a sample, those are always a good place to start.

Also, while WindowsMediaLib is licensed under LGPL, these samples are public domain.  
Use them as you like.  Every one of these samples needs the WindowsMediaLib library
which is not included in this package.  Get the latest version from the SourceForge
website listed above.

The people who wrote these samples usually hang out in 
http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=829805.  If you have questions, 
comments, or just want to say thanks to the people who have taken the time to
create these, feel free to stop by.

Also, if you have samples you think would be useful (or would like to write some), 
that would be the place to get started.
