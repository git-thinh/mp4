V 1.1 Minor updates November 30, 2008

Fix some 64bit issues.  However, see http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa391570(VS.85).aspx
Add support for mixer* methods from http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms712636(VS.85).aspx

No further interfaces are planned for this library.  At one time, it was hoped that the DRM methods 
could be implemented from .Net.  However, between licensing issues (to use DRM, you MUST link in a 
.lib file from MS into your .exe), and technical issues (the contents of that lib are undocumented, 
so reproducing the functionality in .Net without help from MS is all but impossible), the task just 
proved to be too much.
